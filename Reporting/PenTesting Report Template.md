Tips:

- Remember to include screenshots in your report (you'll most likely want to include arrows and highlighted section in your screenshots for less ambiguity) 

- Be sure to reference security frameworks to go along with your report. (NIST, MITRE, PTES, OWASP)

- Finally, be thorough but not overly technical. A CEO of a company who doesn't know much about cybersecurity should be able to understand your report.
